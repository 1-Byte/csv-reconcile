* CSV Reconcile
  Create [[https://github.com/reconciliation-api/specs][reconciliation service]] for [[https://openrefine.org/][OpenRefine]] based on a CSV file after [[http://okfnlabs.org/reconcile-csv/][reconcile-csv]].  This one is
  written in Python and has some more configurability.

** Quick start
   - Clone this repository
   - Run the service
     #+begin_src sh
     $ python -m venv venv                                             # create virtualenv
     $ venv/bin/pip install dist/csv_reconcile-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl  # install package
     $ venv/bin/python -m csv_reconcile --init-db sample/reps.tsv item itemLabel  # start the service
     #+end_src

   The service is run at http://127.0.0.1:5000/reconcile.  You can point at a different host:port by
   adding [[https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/0.12.x/config/][SERVER_NAME]] to the sample.cfg.  Since this is running from a virtualenv, you can simply
   delete the whole lot to clean up.


** Poetry
   This is packaged with [[https://python-poetry.org/docs/][poetry]], so you can use those commands if you have it installed.
